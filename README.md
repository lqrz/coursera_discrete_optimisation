# Dicrete optimisation

This repository combines an overview of the **Discrete Optimization** course offered on Coursera (University of Melbourne) with working Python implementations of the course assignments. It serves both as a course reference and a practical toolkit.

##  Course Overview

**Discrete Optimization** is an intermediate-level course designed to teach fundamental concepts and practical methods in combinatorial optimization. Taught by **Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck** and **Dr. Carleton Coffrin**, the course spans **8 modules** (typically over ~7 weeks, ~10 hours/week) covering key algorithmic paradigms:  

- **Module 0 — Welcome**: Course philosophy, structure, grading, and assignment format :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Module 1 — Knapsack**: Formulation, greedy heuristics, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound, relaxation, search strategies :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Module 2 — Constraint Programming (CP)**: Principles of CP (propagation, global constraints, symmetry-breaking, search strategies); model examples like colorings, N-Queens, Sudoku, set cover :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Module 3 — Local Search**: Neighborhoods, moves, meta-heuristics such as simulated annealing, tabu search, local improvements (e.g. 2-opt), large-neighborhood search :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Module 4 — Linear Programming (LP)**: Simplex algorithm, duality principles :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Module 5 — Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)**: MIP modeling, branch-and-bound, cutting planes, Gomory cuts, branch-and-cut, polyhedral cuts; applied to problems like facility location, graph coloring, TSP :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Module 6 — Advanced Topics I**: Constraint-programming techniques for scheduling and vehicle routing :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Module 7 — Advanced Topics II**: Large Neighborhood Search and Column Generation methods :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
